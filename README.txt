To All Devs, here are some important notes:

[Dependencies and Language Notes]
* Python 2.6 will be used (2.6.2 is where I'm at)
* Packages dependencies:
  * pyOpengl
  * pyQt4



[Coding Style notes]
* I use an edge line at 80, but I go over it sometimes, try not to go beyond about 95
* Source must use LF and not CRLF as newlines



[Hooks that you can grep and use]
* If you grep the source for HELP! you'll find specific places where I know what
  I want, but don't have the knowledge as to how to implement it.  It is usually
  QT specific code so far, because of help files being hard to get.
  
* If you grep the source for TODO: you'll find specific places where something
  still needs to be implemented. (At present (2009-08-27) almost everything is
  TODO, so they are not actively placed in the source.)
